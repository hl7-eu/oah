Title: "Key hydromorphological quality indicators"
Description: """The hydromorphological characteristics include the type and diversity of aquatic habitats, substrate of the bottom and margins, flow type, size of the rivers, land use in the margins, existence of barriers, or other artificial structures and land use in the margins. Those characteristics influence the river continuum, the habitats available for the aquatic biota, the species migration and the sediments, water flow and energy transferences over a river basin"""
